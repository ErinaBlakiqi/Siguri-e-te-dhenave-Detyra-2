DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHMS

1.TRIFID CIPHER (Encryption)
This algorithm implements the Trifid Cipher encryption technique in Java.
The Trifid Cipher is a cryptographic technique that combines elements of substitution and transposition ciphers to encrypt messages.
The key points provided are:
  1.Preparation of the alphabet for encryption, including a secret key provided by the user.
  2.Arranging the alphabet to create a random permutation of letters.
  3.Creation of a three-dimensional cube to represent the prepared alphabet for encryption.
  4.Retrieve the plaintext from the input.
  5.Identification of coordinates for each letter from the plaintext using the three-dimensional cube.
  6.Utilization of the found coordinates in the cube to encrypt the plaintext, based on the structure and logic of the Trifid Cipher.
  7.Display of the encrypted text for the user.
