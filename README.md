   - Write the desired plaintext
   - Write a keyword
   - See the encripted text



DESCRIPTION OF ALGORITHMS
1. TRIFID CIPHER (Encryption)
    This algorithm implements the Trifid Cipher encryption technique in Java.
    The Trifid Cipher is a cryptographic technique that combines elements of substitution and transposition ciphers to encrypt messages.
    The key points provided are:
      1. Preparation of the alphabet for encryption, including a secret key provided by the user.
      2. Arranging the alphabet to create a random permutation of letters.
      3. Creation of a three-dimensional cube to represent the prepared alphabet for encryption.
      4. Retrieve the plaintext from the input.
      5. Identification of coordinates for each letter from the plaintext using the three-dimensional cube.
      6. Utilization of the found coordinates in the cube to encrypt the plaintext, based on the structure and logic of the Trifid Cipher.
      7. Display of the encrypted text for the user.

2. Columnar Transposition (Encryption)
     Columnar transposition is a technique used in cryptography to encrypt and decrypt messages. Here's a step-by-step explanation of how columnar transposition works:
     1. Chose a Keyword or Keyphrase: The first step is to choose a keyword or keyphrase that will be used to determine the order in which the columns are arranged. For              example, if the keyword is "CRYPTO", each letter of the keyword represents the order in which the columns will be arranged.
     2. Write the Message in Rows: Write the message to be encrypted in rows, typically left-to-right and top-to-bottom, filling up rows before starting a new one. If the            message doesn't fill up a row completely, fill the remaining spaces with placeholder characters, usually "X" or "Z".
     3. Arrange Columns According to Keyword: Write down the keyword above the rows, in alphabetical order. Each letter of the keyword represents a column.
     4. Rearrange Columns: Rearrange the columns of the message according to the alphabetical order of the keyword. This means if the keyword is "CRYPTO", the columns would          be arranged in the order of "C", "O", "P", "R", "T", "Y".
     5. Read the Encrypted Message: Read the rearranged columns from left to right and top to bottom to get the encrypted message.
